# Have you ever wished to spin up Kubernetes on-demand in only a minute? Now you can. 

Let's be honest about Kubernetes. Using it is easy. But setting up Kubernetes is a whole different story because of its complexity. You have to be an expert to set up Kubernetes, and even then, it can take hours to create a working environment. Far from ideal when you want to introduce your software or train people to learn about your technology and they first need to wade through an instructional swamp to set up Kubernetes before they can work with your software. So, you keep your fingers crossed that they don't, but you would understand if they drop out.
 

## Your worst nightmare

And if this isn't enough, it can even get worse. Imagine that prospect you have been working on for weeks finally bites: "Okay, I want to try your software and set up a proof of concept." Your heart jumps when you hear these words, but your prospect isn't finished yet: "The proof of concept needs to be done in Kubernetes, but that won't be a problem, would it?"

O, no, not Kubernetes, bangs through your head. Please, let me misunderstand. But you didn't. Well, maybe there is an escape. So you suggest: "Does your IT department have Kubernetes experience?" The prospect chuckles: "Yes, they do, but they are on a team-building. So, I have to do it myself." You bow your head. The only thing you can do is send the megabytes of Kubernetes setup instructions and hope for the best.

"I will let you know," are the prospect's last words. The next day you send an email to follow up. And the day after, you leave a voice mail. But it stays silent. A doomsday feeling starts creeping in, and a few weeks later, you hear from a former colleague that the prospect has chosen your competitor.
